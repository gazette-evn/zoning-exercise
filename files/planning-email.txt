MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Dear Council Members,

Please find attached the staff recommendation for the Downtown Zoning Overlay proposal. This memo summarizes our findings following an extensive community engagement process.

Key points for your review:

1. The proposal reflects input from over 2,800 community members gathered through town halls, focus groups, and surveys.

2. Recommended changes include increased density allowances, reduced parking requirements, and a new affordable housing incentive program.

3. Economic projections indicate significant fiscal benefits, including $2.4 million in new annual property tax revenue.

4. Environmental review found no significant impacts.

Staff will present the full proposal at the December 12 council meeting. A public comment period is scheduled for December 1-10.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions before the presentation.

Best regards,

James Chen
Director of Planning and Community Development
City of Riverside
